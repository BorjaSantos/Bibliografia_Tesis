There have been many advancements in the pharmacologic treatment of
schizophrenia; however, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment remain an
intractable part of this illness. Donepezil is an anticholinesterase inhibitor
with cognitive enhancing effects approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease 
that has shown some benefit in the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, 15 
inpatients at a state hospital with a history of schizophrenia were administered 
donepezil in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Neurocognitive testing
and psychiatric ratings were completed at baseline and at regular intervals for
18 weeks. Results indicated that donepezil treatment was associated with modest
improvements in psychiatric symptoms and improved verbal learning. These results 
suggest that donepezil may be helpful as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of 
psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in a subgroup of schizophrenic
patients.
