Abstract
  Dysfunction in interpersonal relations, work, education, and/or self care is a hallmark of schizophrenia. Numerous studies have attempted to clarify how cognitive deficits may be related to patients' positive and negative symptoms and real-world functioning, and have evaluated interventions to improve patient outcomes. Though effective interventions have proven elusive, the literature continues to grow rapidly. This review of the most recent studies places them in the broader context of the evolution of knowledge of cognition, while focusing on the definition of cognitive domains, the ways in which cognitive deficits may be related to social functioning (among other aspects of real-world functioning), and the patterns and implications of cognitive deficits in old age with respect to patients' health and perceived quality of life. To date, lengthy, multifaceted interventions have shown the most promise. To improve self care, interventions targeting patients' dysfunctional beliefs about aging may be particularly helpful.  2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

Abstract
  Schizophrenia is a disabling, chronic psychiatric disorder with a prevalence rate of 0.5-1% in the general population. Symptoms include positive (e.g., delusions, hallucinations), negative (e.g., blunted affect, social withdrawal), as well as cognitive symptoms (e.g., memory and attention problems). Although 75-85% of patients with schizophrenia report cognitive impairments, the underlying neuropharmacological mechanisms are not well understood and currently no effective treatment is available for these impairments. This has led to the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) initiative, which established seven cognitive domains that are fundamentally impaired in schizophrenia. These domains include verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, working memory, attention and vigilance, processing speed, reasoning and problem solving, and social cognition. Recently, a growing number of studies have been conducted trying to identify the underlying neuropharmacological mechanisms of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia patients. Specific cognitive impairments seem to arise from different underlying neuropharmacological mechanisms. However, most review articles describe cognition in general and an overview of the mechanisms involved in these seven separate cognitive domains is currently lacking. Therefore, we reviewed the underlying neuropharmacological mechanisms focusing on the domains as established by the MATRICS initiative which are considered most crucial in schizophrenia.  2013 Vingerhoets, Bloemen, Bakker and van Amelsvoort.

Abstract
  Background: The disruption of dopamine (DA) systems has been implicated in major neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia. However, effective movement in patients with Parkinson's disease in certain situations, kinesia paradoxa, and typical antipsychotic-resistant and atypical antipsychotic- sensitive positive symptoms of schizophrenia and their underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Methods: The experimental procedures and housing conditions were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Approval ID: 12-43), and all of the animals were cared for and treated humanely in accordance with our institutional animal experimentation guidelines. Dopamine-deficient (DD) mice were generated using a transgenic rescue approach, in which tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in noradrenergic and adrenergic cells in mice that lack TH expression was complemented by a specific DA b-hydroxylase gene promoter. These mice exhibited a restoration of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine synthesis and prevention of the usual perinatal lethality and cardiac dysfunction observed in TH knockout mice. Dopamine, serotonin, NE, and acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations in brain microdialysates were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HTEC-500, Eicom, Kyoto, Japan). Locomotor activity was measured with Supermex (Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan) and a sensor monitor mounted above the chamber. After a 180 min habituation period, the drugs were administered subcutaneously, and locomotor activity was monitored continuously for 180 min. The mice walked freely on the runway, and their locomotor movements were recorded at 200 frames per second using a high-speed digital image camera system (HAS-220, DITECT, Tokyo, Japan). Movement analyses were limited to the sagittal plane parallel to the direction of walking. Custom-designed image analysis software (DIPP-Motion 2D, DITECT, Tokyo, Japan) was used to extract the two-dimensional coordinates of the various joint markers and reconstruct a stick diagram representation of the right hindlimb. The expression profiles of the genes related to ACh metabolism and signaling transduction pathways were analyzed using the Illumina iScan system with MouseRef-8 Expression Bead- Chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), which contain probes that detect over 24 000 transcripts. Immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry were also performed. Results: The present study showed that DD mice can move effectively and are rather hyperactive. DD mice require daily administration of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the precursor of DA, to maintain feeding. After 3 days withdrawal from L-DOPA, their striatal extracellular DA levels fell to less than 0.2% of wildtype mice, and they were hyperactive with a slight movement disorder in a novel environment. The atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine markedly ameliorated this hyperactivity, with no effect of the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol. Furthermore, the nonselective muscarinic ACh receptor agonist oxotremorine- M and ACh esterase inhibitor donepezil blocked hyperactivity in DD mice. These mice exhibited a reduction of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene and protein expression in the basal ganglia and a reduction of extracellular ACh levels in the striatum, suggesting that reduced cholinergic function may underlie hyperactivity in DD mice. Conclusions: The DD mice in the present study revealed a novel motor-control and hyperactivity mechanism that is independent of DA and involves ACh systems. The activity of ChAT has been found to be normal or reduced in the striatum in PD patients. Furthermore, the basal ganglia are interconnected with the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). The PPN is thought to be involved in the initiation and modulation of gait and other stereotyped movements. In PD patients, the loss of cholinergic neurons in the PPN has been reported. The decrease in dopaminergic neuronal transmission in the basal ganglia might result in the inactivation of the PPN in PD patients and DD mice. The present results, together with previous findings, suggest that the ACh systems may be involved in the mechanisms that underlie DA-independent motor control, and motor impairment in PD patients may be ameliorated by DAindependent mechanisms. Although DA plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis and treatment of schizophrenia, several lines of evidence suggest an important role for the cholinergic system in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Hyperactivity induced by muscarinic receptor antagonists has been suggested to model antimuscarinic psychosis and cholinergic-related psychosis in schizophrenia. Hyperactivity in DD mice was ameliorated by a muscarinic receptor agonist in the present study, suggesting that such hyperactivity may be induced by similar mechanisms that underlie cholinergic-related psychosis in schizophrenia. DD mice might be useful for the identification of the neuronal mechanisms involved in cholinergic-related psychosis in schizophrenia.

Abstract
  The growing worldwide use of pharmaceuticals is managed in some countries by a regulatory system which sharply divides legal use into licensed and unlicensed categories. We examine how for the range of psychotropics this simultaneously restricts the possible benefits to patients, prescribers and producers in some domains, while failing to manage the risks in others. A more flexible system, which shares at an earlier stage experience and evidence on benefits and risks in patients, previously marginalized on the grounds of age, diagnosis or comorbidity, would aid the development of safer, more effective 'real-world prescribing'. Practical recommendations are made for a new model of research and prescribing governance, to enable more effective repurposing of these treatments.  The Author(s), 2013.

Abstract
  Objectives: To assess the efficacy of a cognitive enhancer, donepezil, as an adjuvant treatment to antipsychotics on clinical outcomes of schizophrenia. Methods: Systematic review with meta-analysis to obtain appropriate evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of donepezil plus antipsychotics versus placebo plus antipsychotics in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia for the following outcomes: General psychopathology, positive/negative symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Effect size estimates corrected for small sample size trials (Hedges' g) were calculated for parallel trials and cross-over trials. Negative values for Hedges' g denote an effect favouring the combined treatment. When needed, values for the cross-over correlation were imputed from available individual data to obtain the Hedges' g estimates. The individual estimates were pooled with a random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Seven trials (4 cross-over, 3 parallel) were included. Four trials provided data on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for total and general psychopathology scores. Three trials provided data for PANSS positive scores and 5 trials provided data for PANSS negative scores. Three trials provided data on depression scores. The combined treatment did not show differences in any of the assessed outcomes: PANSS total scores (g = -0.57, 95% CI = -2.11 to 0.96 I2 = 67%); PANSS General Psychopathology scores (g = -0.20, 95% CI = -0.74 to 0.34 I2 = 0%); PANSS positive symptoms (g = -0.06, 95% CI = -0.73 to 0.60, I2 = 0%); PANSS negative symptoms (g = -0.43, 95% CI = -1.98 to 1.12, I2 = 86%); depression scores (g = -0.35, 95% CI = -1.20 to 0.49, I2 = 0%). Conclusions: The combination of donepezil with antipsychotic treatment does not improve clinical outcomes in schizophrenia.

Abstract
  Over the last few years, latrepirdine, a demode antihistamine drug, has been proposed to be useful for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, and more recently schizophrenia. The mechanisms and pharmacological targets that are responsible for the beneficial effects on neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown. But it has been proposed that latrepirdine may modulate several targets including voltage-gate Ca<sup>+2</sup> channels, mitochondrial permeability pore transition, or several neurotransmitter receptors. Herein, we present a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to ascertain the efficacy and safety of latrepirdine on cognitive function. By doing a search in electronic databases, we found five clinical trials in which the effect of latrepirdine on cognition function has been studied, and this was evaluated using MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL, and NPI scores. Latrepirdine generally presented a good safety profile; it was well tolerated when given alone or in combination with a variety of other drugs. We observed heterogeneous results between trials; latrepirdine failed to exert a significant beneficial effect although it tended to improve cognitive scores. The only significant benefit that we found was for the NPI score in Alzheimer's disease patients.  2014 A IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

Abstract
  Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders bear an economic burden of more than $2 trillion in the US and EU and rake in upwards of $80 billion a year for the pharmaceutical industry. Yet they have become as much a vice as a potential virtue. A novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) medication bears every promise of outshining the likes of Lipitor in blockbuster status, but its chances of reaching the market are also nearly 50% lower, and development costs 30% higher, than those of its cardiovascular counterpart.

Abstract
  Objective: This article captures the proceedings of a meeting aimed at defining clinically meaningful effects for use in randomized controlled trials for psychopharmacological agents. Design: Experts from a variety of disciplines defined clinically meaningful effects from their perspectives along with viewpoints about how to design and interpret randomized controlled trials. Setting: The article offers relevant, practical, and sometimes anecdotal information about clinically meaningful effects and how to interpret them. Participants: The concept for this session was the work of co-chairs Richard Keefe and the late Andy Leon. Faculty included Richard Keefe, PhD; James McNulty, AbScB; Robert S. Epstein, MD, MS; Shelby D. Reed, PhD; Juan Sanchez, MD; Ginger Haynes, PhD; Andrew C. Leon, PhD; Helena Chmura Kraemer, PhD; Ellen Frank, PhD, and Kenneth L. Davis, MD. Results: The term clinically meaningful effect is an important aspect of designing and interpreting randomized controlled trials but can be particularly difficult in the setting of psychopharmacology where effect size may be modest, particularly over the short term, because of a strong response to placebo. Payers, regulators, patients, and clinicians have different concerns about clinically meaningful effects and may describe these terms differently. The use of moderators in success rate differences may help better delineate clinically meaningful effects. Conclusion: There is no clear consensus on a single definition for clinically meaningful differences in randomized controlled trials, and investigators must be sensitive to specific concerns of stakeholders in psychopharmacology in order to design and execute appropriate clinical trials.

Abstract
  Background and Objectives: Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a frequent and incapacitating side effect of first-generation antipsychotics. Although second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) seem to be associated with a decreased risk of TD, it remains a severe, unresolved iatrogenic condition. Moreover, there is no commonly accepted effective treatment for TD. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess evidence regarding the effectiveness of different therapeutic interventions for TD. Methods: We performed a systematic review focussing exclusively on randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched the MEDLINE database (1997 to 2011) using the keyword "tardive dyskinesia" within the "title" search field. Twenty-six RCTs were included. Based on the evidence from RCTs, we built a decision tree that healthcare professionals can use to choose an effective therapeutic intervention for TD. Results: Four therapeutic interventions were found to be effective in TD (vitamin B6, ginkgo biloba, branched-chain amino acids, and piracetam). Conclusions: Patients with TD could benefit from the therapeutic interventions supported by the data accumulated from RCTs.

Abstract
  Clinical trials of pharmacological agents targeting negative symptoms in schizophrenia are reviewed. The focus is on trials that occurred in patients who were stable on an antipsychotic medication at entry to the trial. A small number of trials compared antipsychotics as monotherapy for negative symptoms. Although the data supporting amisulpride for negative symptoms is promising the trials have limitations and it is plausible that the advantages of amisulpride over placebo may result from effects on secondary negative symptoms. Among available agents, antidepressant medications may have effects in negative symptoms. Other promising agents include minocycline, glutamatergic agents, and alpha-7 nicotinic agents. More than 15 active trials are currently underway to evaluate new treatments for negative symptoms.  2013.
