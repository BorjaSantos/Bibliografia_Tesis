N2  - There is a growing interest in possible links between impaired insulin signaling and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Insulin and insulin-signaling mechanisms are important for neuronal survival, and central nervous system neurodegeneration is associated with dysfunctional neuronal insulin receptors. This short review focuses on recent findings that many important components of Alzheimer's disease appear to stem from imbalances in insulin signaling intrinsic to the brain, rather than systemic insulin imbalances, and that treatments aimed at redressing insulin imbalances in the brain could be effective therapies.  2006 Prous Science.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Substantial progress has been made in identifying how the treatment parameters used in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) impact its cognitive side effects. However, there is limited information regarding the role of memory enhancers in post-ECT cognitive disturbances. We evaluated the therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy of the memory-enhancing drug donepezil hydrochloride on cognition of patients undergoing ECT. METHODS: A triple blind (the study subjects, clinician assessing the cognition, and the data analyst were unaware of subject allocation for trial assessment) randomized controlled trial was carried out in a General Hospital Psychiatry Unit. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups. One group received ECT with placebo, whereas the other group received ECT and donepezil (a memory-enhancing drug). Study participants were assessed in post-ECT period to analyze cognitive deficits and to compare the differences in 2 groups, as regards recovery of various aspects of cognition. RESULTS: The post-ECT recovery of various components of cognition was more rapid in patients using donepezil as compared to those not given donepezil (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This significant improvement in recovery time among patients receiving donepezil bears therapeutic implication in immediate post-ECT cognitive deficits.

N2  - Objective: Cognitive impairment and negative signs are common in patients with schizophrenia. Up to 35% of elderly patients with schizophrenia fulfill the diagnostic criteria of dementia. Donepezil inhibits cholinesterase, thus enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the efficacy of donepezil in elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia and severe cognitive impairment. Method: Following baseline assessment, patients were randomly assigned to receive either donepezil or placebo. The dose was 5 mg daily for the first week and 10 mg for an additional 11 weeks. The procedure was repeated using the crossover compound. The Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) were used to assess the severity of symptoms, cognitive status and intervention effects. Results: Twenty subjects were enrolled (15 females, five males), mean age 70.2 years (SD 6.5) and mean duration of disease 38.5 years (SD 9.3). A modest treatment effect was found for both placebo and donepezil treatment periods. No crossover effect was found. No statistical differences were demonstrated between the two treatment groups (CGI p = 0.37, PANSS p = 0.71, ADAS-Cog p = 0.86). Two patients died during the study period due to unrelated causes and one patient discontinued participation due to increased agitation. Conclusion: Donepezil does not seem to improve negative signs and cognitive impairment in elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia.  2006 International Psychogeriatric Association.

N2  - Rationale: Schizophrenia is a disorder with cognitive deficits that could stem from cholinergic dysfunction. Objectives: Our aim was to examine if donepezil administered to stable, medicated outpatients with schizophrenia improves cognition and psychopathology. Methods: We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of donepezil up to 10 mg/day added for 8 weeks to ongoing antipsychotic treatment in 36 typical community-treated schizophrenia patients not selected for cognitive impairment. Results: Donepezil did not improve measures of cognition or psychopathology. It was well tolerated. Conclusion: Consistent with other studies, addition of donepezil to stable patients with schizophrenia did not improve cognition or measures of psychopathology. This result does not support the hypothesis that residual symptoms and cognitive problems result from a cholinergic deficit that can be remedied by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. A donepezil add-on strategy might make sense in selected schizophrenia cases where a pathological process is known to affect cholinergic neurons (e.g., history of head injury or comorbid dementia).

T1  - Cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia: Potential benefits of cholinesterase inhibitor adjunctive therapy
A1  - Ferreri F.

A1  - Gauthier S.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Objective: In schizophrenia, cognitive dysfunctions commonly affect attention, memory and executive function, interfere with functional outcome and remain difficult to treat. Previous studies have implicated the cholinergic system in cognitive functioning. In Alzheimer's disease, cholinergic agonists have shown modest clinical benefits on cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Impaired cholinergic activity might also be involved in schizophrenia. Hence the role of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) as adjunctive therapy is under study. We aimed to review the literature and evaluate the overall effectiveness of ChEI adjunctive therapy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Methods: We conducted a computer-based search using PubMed (up to February 15, 2006) and ISI Web of Science (conference proceeding abstracts from January 2003 to December 2005) databases. We used the search terms "schizophrenia," "cognition or memory" and "tacrine or donepezil or rivastigmine or galantamine." Studies included were critically analyzed for allocation, blindness, duration and study design, demographic data, and clinical and neuropsychological outcome assessments. We excluded studies that involved patients with psychiatric disorders other than schizophrenia-spectrum or if they involved animals or molecular investigations. We also excluded conference proceeding abstracts with no explicit neuropsychological battery and/or results. Results: Data on ChEI as adjunctive therapy for the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia are sparse and so far derived from small samples and mostly open uncontrolled studies. ChEI's potential in long-term management has barely been documented and remains to be fully explored. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence on whether ChEI should be used for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia. Nevertheless, further studies with appropriate trial designs and outcome measures in homogenous schizophrenia populations are warranted.  2006 CMA Media Inc.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - In contrast to research studies that limit the use of concomitant psychotropic medications in the treatment of schizophrenia, polypharmacy is common in real-world, clinical practice. The use of psychotropic medications as an adjunct to antipsychotic agents is often necessitated by the poor response to monotherapy with one antipsychotic agent. This paper discusses the prevalence of polypharmacy in clinical settings, reviews the evidence for the adjunctive use of antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and other psychotropics in the treatment of schizophrenia, and offers suggestions toward use of polypharmacy in difficult and practical clinical settings.  2006 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Donepezil, 5 mg/d for 6 wk then 10 mg/d for 6 wk, and placebo daily for 12 wk in a double-blind cross-over paradigm, was added to the therapeutic regimen of 13 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders, clinically stable on atypical antipsychotic medications. Patients had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, ranging from no depression to clinically significant depression. There was no worsening or induction of depression in individual patients or the group as a whole. In addition there was a statistically significant antidepressant effect in the group as a whole during the donepezil condition and a clinically significant antidepressant effect in the patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms, although there were not enough depressed patients in the group to conclude that donepezil may have antidepressant effects. Thus, in this study, donepezil did not induce or worsen depressive symptoms in schizophrenic and schizoaffective disorder patients. Copyright  2005 CINP.

T1  - The past, present, and future of psychopharmacology in Korea
A1  - Min S.K.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - This paper reviews the history of psychopharmacology in Korea after 1885, when Western medicine was first introduced to Korea. In the past, Korean psychiatrists had occasionally used barbiturates and fever therapy to treat mental patients, as did psychiatrists worldwide, and psychosocial treatments were common until drug treatments became readily available in the 1960s. At this time, the true era of psychopharmacology and biological psychiatry in Korea began with the use of chlorpromazine followed by use of other phenothiazines, haloperidol, meprobamate, and tricyclic antidepressants. A small number of pioneers trained abroad in biological and pharmacological psychiatry and neuroscience. Following their return, Korean psychopharmacology developed along with international developments in psychopharmacology and neuroscience. In the 1990s, a second generation of antidepressants and antipsychotic agents was introduced to Korea, and currently most major psychotherapeutic drugs are available in Korea soon after they appear in the world market. Until the 1990s, most psychopharmacological research was clinical. Basic research has been rare due not only to lack of financial support but also to unfavorable conditions for research. The general conditions for research have been improving with the recent economical growth in Korea. Many young researchers have returned to Korea after training abroad and are now leading research and international collaboration activities. Accordingly, Korean psychopharmacological research and related aspects of neuroscience have progressed greatly. This paper discusses also future directions for psychopharmacological research and the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology (KCNP) as related to projected socio-cultural changes and especially to integrating drug treatment with psychosocial treatment.  2006, Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Treatment resistance in schizophrenia creates a persistent public health problem and leads to repeated hospitalization. In search for a treatment for such patients, psychiatrists have co-prescribed multiple psychotropic medications simultaneously. Such practice is based mostly on clinical experience, rather than research derived evidence. Such combinations may not be fully "effective" if the cost, adverse effect profile and the potential for noncompliance by patients secondary to regimen complexity are considered. Is it really wise to try these various combinations of costly medicines in the mental health system, which is already struggling with its limited resources and funding worldwide? However, if mental health policy makers restrict reimbursement for such "unproven" combinations, patients might not receive the benefits of some of these combinations, which are showing some promise for the treatment of resistant schizophrenia.  2006 Taylor & Francis.

T1  - Pharmacological approaches to the management of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia
A1  - Harvey P.D.
A1  - McClure M.M.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia as deficits that are present in the majority of patients with schizophrenia frequently precede the onset of other symptoms and persist even after other symptoms have been effectively treated. The use of atypical antipsychotics has produced some small improvements, although the need for adjunctive treatment specifically targeting cognitive dysfunction is gaining widespread acceptance. Animal models and some small clinical trials have yielded results that are promising but not definitive. Psychosocial interventions have also met with some success in ameliorating some cognitive limitations. The mixed results of pharmacological interventions are most likely to be as a result of a combination of methodological flaws of many studies, poor outcome measures, dose administration effects and problems with the agents themselves.  2006 Adis Data Information BV.

T1  - Use of magnetic resonance imaging in tracking the course and treatment of schizophrenia
A1  - Kumari V.
A1  - Cooke M.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Confirming the early conceptualization of Bleuler (1911) and Kraepelin (1919), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated structural and functional brain abnormalities, predominantly involving the frontal and temporal lobes, in schizophrenia. Most of the abnormalities are already present at illness onset. However, there is, growing evidence for treatment-related neural changes in schizophrenia, such as enlargement of the caudate nucleus (neurotoxic effect) with the use of typical antipsychotics and increases in cortical volumes and improved functional responses (neurotrophic effect) with the use of atypical antipsychotics. More recently, brain changes during the prodrome and transition-to-illness stages of schizophrenia have begun to be characterized. Another area of importance is the use of MRI, as a biological marker, to monitor and define partial or full resistance to medication. Understanding the trait- and state-related influences of brain abnormalities during the course of the illness is critical for developing effective treatment and possibly prevention strategies in schizophrenia.  2006 Future Drugs Ltd.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia and are a major contributor to functional disability. These impairments persist even when patients are in remission of psychotic symptoms and have, to date, eluded treatment. While some improvement is noted with existing medications, current trends in this field include studying and searching for adjunctive treatments to truly remediate cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Psychosocial treatments have demonstrated some success, but the use of existing cognitive enhancers in schizophrenia treatment has provided little cognitive improvement. This paper reviews the current status of cognitive deficit treatment in schizophrenia and offers suggestions for future work.  The Thomson Corporation.

T1  - NMDA receptors are not alone: Dynamic regulation of NMDA receptor structure and function by neuregulins and transient cholesterol-rich membrane domains leads to disease-specific nuances of glutamate-signalling
A1  - Schrattenholz A.

Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA-) subtype are tetrameric allosteric and ligand-gated calcium channels. They are modulated by a variety of endogenous ligands and ions and play a pivotal role in memory-related signal transduction due to a voltage-dependent block by magnesium, which makes them Hebbian coincidence detectors. On the structural level NMDA receptors have an enormous flexibility due to seven genes (NR1, NR2A-D and NR3A-B), alternative splicing, RNA-editing and extensive posttranslational modifications, like phosphorylation and glycosylation. NMDA receptors are thought to be responsible for excitotoxicity and subsequent downstream events like neuroinflammation and apoptosis and thus have been implicated in many important human pathologies, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson' disease, depression, epilepsy, trauma and stroke to schizophrenia. This fundamental significance of NMDA receptor-related excitotoxicity is discussed in the context of the developing clinical success of Memantine, but moreover set into relation to various proteomic and genetic markers of said diseases. The very complex localisational and functional regulation of NMDA receptors appears to be dependent on neuregulins and receptor tyrosine kinases in cholesterol-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), calcium-related mitochondrial feedback-loops and subsynaptic structural elements like PSD-95 (post-synaptic density protein of 95 kD). The flexibility and multitude of interaction partners and possibilities of these highly dynamic molecular systems are discussed in terms of drug development strategies, in particular comparing high affinity and sub-type specific ligands to currently successful or promising therapies.  2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Although the 5-hydroxytryptamine6 (5-HT6) receptor was discovered only recently, its almost exclusive distribution in the brain makes it a promising, novel, target for central nervous system (CNS)-mediated diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (cognitive function), schizophrenia, anxiety and obesity. In the past few years a significant research interest has advanced the understanding of the functional roles and the pharmacophore requirements of this receptor. Two 5-HT6 receptor antagonists have already entered Phase II clinical trials for the enhancement of cognitive function. Since the first discovery of selective ligands for the 5-HT6 receptor by HTS in 1998, several medicinal-chemistry-driven approaches have delivered highly selective lead structures with well-defined functionalities, starting from either the endogenous ligand 5-HT or the chemical structures identified by HTS. The concept of 'scaffold hopping' has been employed to expand the variability of the available chemical scaffolds and to generate patentable ligands. Supported by pharmacophore models, which have been established recently, the binding and functionality (structure-activity relationships) of the lead structures have been optimized further.  2005 Elsevier Ltd.

T1  - Effects of antipsychotic drugs on memory and attention in schizophrenia
A1  - Lee J.
A1  - Park S.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Neurocognitive deficits are cardinal features of schizophrenia, and are important predictors of functional outcome. In this article, we focus on the effects of antipsychotic drug treatment on two key cognitive symptoms, those of attention and memory. A review of the relevant literature was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on the cognitive impairments exhibited by schizophrenic patients. Our review suggests that atypical antipsychotic drugs more effectively ameliorate cognitive impairments than do typical antipsychotic drugs, and that each atypical antipsychotic drug exerts selective effects on attention and memory. In addition, we offer a brief survey of unconventional and novel treatments for neurocognitive symptoms.

T1  - Catatonic schizophrenia and the use of memantine
A1  - Carpenter S.S.
A1  - Hatchett A.D.
A1  - Fuller M.A.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case of catatonic schizophrenia treated with memantine that resulted in a rapid reduction of catatonic symptoms. CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old male with catatonic schizophrenia presented with bizarre and catatonic behavior manifested by mutism, waxy flexibility, immobility, staring, nonresponsiveness to verbal commands, grimacing, rigidity, and posturing. During the course of his hospitalization, he was treated with memantine up to 10 mg/day. The catatonia responded rapidly and significantly to memantine. DISCUSSION: Few treatment options are available for the management of catatonia. Lorazepam is generally the agent that has been used most often and has had varying degrees of success. Our report adds to a recently published case that also suggested that memantine might be useful for the management of catatonic behaviors in a patient with schizophrenia. While its mechanism of action is unknown, it has been thought that glutamate antagonists, such as memantine, may be beneficial in catatonic schizophrenia due to a glutamatergic dysfunction present in catatonic patients. It also has been hypothesized that there is a decrease in -aminobutyric acid released to the supplementary motor areas, resulting in less glutamate inhibition. This results in a net effect of glutamatergic hyperfunction in the striatum, which may produce catatonia. Based on this hypothesis, memantine would be beneficial as an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonist to decrease the amount of glutamate in the striatum and thereby relieve symptoms of catatonia. However, these potential benefits must be weighed against recently reported adverse reactions associated with memantine use, namely, psychosis and seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Memantine produced a rapid and significant reduction in catatonic symptoms in our patient with catatonic schizophrenia.

T1  - Nicotinic cholinergic antagonists: A novel approach for the treatment of autism
A1  - Lippiello P.M.
Y1  - 2006//
N2  - Evidence supports the hypothesis that normalization of cholinergic tone by selective antagonism of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (NNRs) may ameliorate the core symptoms of autism. As often is the case, epidemiology has provided the first important clues. It is well recognized that psychiatric patients are significantly more often smokers than the general population. The only known exceptions are obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), catatonic schizophrenia and interestingly, autism. In this regard, clinical studies with nicotine have demonstrated amelioration of symptoms of a number of diseases and disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ADHD and Tourette's syndrome. Nicotine's agonist properties at CNS NNRs have been implicated in these effects and support the concept of self-medication as a strong motivation for smoking in cognitively compromised individuals. On the other hand, the inverse correlation between autism and smoking suggests that smoking does not provide symptomatic relief and may actually be indicative of an active avoidance of nicotine's agonist effects in this disorder. Neuroanatomical evidence is consistent with this idea based on the presence of hypercholinergic architecture in the autistic brain, particularly during the first few years of development, making the avoidance of further stimulation of an already hyperactive cholinergic system plausible. This may also explain why stimulants (known to increase dopamine levels as do NNR agonists) appear to aggravate autistic symptoms and why studies with cholinesterase inhibitors that increase acetylcholine levels in the brain have yielded variable effects in autism. Taken together, the evidence suggests the possibility that nicotinic cholinergic antagonism may in fact be palliative. Pharmacological evidence supports this hypothesis. For example, antidepressants, many of which are now known to be non-competitive NNR antagonists, have been used successfully to treat a number of autistic symptoms. More specifically, there is anecdotal evidence from at least one medical practitioner that mecamylamine, a non-selective NNR antagonist, is effective in treating many autistic symptoms, particularly those that are refractory to most other treatments. Clearly there is a need for carefully controlled clinical studies with novel selective NNR antagonists to explore their potential as a new and exciting approach for the treatment of autism.  2005 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Schizophrenia generally manifests cognitive disorders of subjects affected by this illness. Acetylcholine is the main neurotrasmettitor involved in the modulation of cognitive processes as attention, memory and executive functions. The aim of our study is to examine the effects of anticholinesterasic drugs in addiction to atypical antipsychotics on cognitive functions in subjects with schizophrenia. Participant to the study 14 subjects affected by schizophrenia. Subjects have been divided in two sub-groups on the grounds of pharmachological treatment used. A first group (N= 8) it's been treated only with risperidone (monotherapy group); the second one (N=7) it's been treated with donepezil in addition to risperidone (donepezil+ risperidone group). The group treated with donepezil + risperidone evidenced, after 3 and 6 months, statistically significant improvements in attention, in executive functions and in understanding first order Theory of Mind. Our findings are in agreement with those reported by MacEwan et al. (2001). Even if preliminary, our results prove the effectiveness of using anticholinesterasics drugs in addition to atypical antipsychotic treatment, especially in improving attentive functioning.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia and other delayed-onset abnormal involuntary movement disorders may occur as a result of the use of psychotropic drugs. A distinction is usually made between classic tardive dyskinesia (TD) (orobuccal-lingual-facial) and tardive dystonia, tardive tremor (TT), tardive akathisia, and other related syndromes. In spite of the development of atypical antipsychotics with fewer side effects, tardive movement disorders nevertheless continue to present a significant clinical and therapeutic challenge. Several reports have suggested that donepezil may be helpful in the treatment of TD. METHOD: A preliminary study was conducted of 7 patients (5 women and 2 men) enrolled over a period of 6 months who had been experiencing TT for a period of at least 1 year. The ages of the patients ranged from 64 to 79 years, and all patients were on stable antipsychotic therapy. Donepezil was added to their usual treatment for 8 weeks. The severity of patients' extrapyramidal symptoms was assessed using the tremor subscale of the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) and self-rated with a modification of the Clinical Global Impressions scale, the Subjective Clinical Improvement Impression scale. The clinical response was evaluated by comparing the rating scores at baseline prior to donepezil treatment and every 2 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: The addition of donepezil (up to 10 mg/day) was associated with a clinically significant improvement (from 37.5% to 63.6%) on the SAS tremor subscale following 4 weeks of therapy. Only 1 patient discontinued follow-up due to side effects. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that donepezil may be effective in the treatment of TT, and this finding should be evaluated further by a randomized controlled study.

We sought to explore the incidence and management of TD in the era of atypical antipsychotics because it remains an important iatrogenic adverse effect. Methods: We conducted a review of TD incidence and management literature from January 1, 1965, to January 31, 2004, using the terms tardive dyskinesia, management, therapy, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole. Additional articles were obtained by searching the bibliographies of relevant references. We considered articles that contributed to the current understanding of both the incidence of TD with atypical antipsychotics and management strategies for TD. Results: The incidence of TD is significantly lower with atypical, compared with typical, antipsychotics, but cases of de novo TD have been identified. Evidence suggests that atypical antipsychotic therapy ameliorates long-standing TD. This paper outlines management strategies for TD in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusion: The literature supports the recommendation that atypical antipsychotics should be the first antipsychotics used in patients who have experienced TD as a result of treatment with conventional antipsychotic agents. The other management strategies discussed may prove useful in certain patients.

N2  - There have been many advancements in the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia; however, negative symptoms and cognitive impairment remain an intractable part of this illness. Donepezil is an anticholinesterase inhibitor with cognitive enhancing effects approved for the treatment of Alzheimer disease that has shown some benefit in the treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, 15 inpatients at a state hospital with a history of schizophrenia were administered donepezil in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. Neurocognitive testing and psychiatric ratings were completed at baseline and at regular intervals for 18 weeks. Results indicated that donepezil treatment was associated with modest improvements in psychiatric symptoms and improved verbal learning. These results suggest that donepezil may be helpful as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms and cognitive impairment in a subgroup of schizophrenic patients.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The serotonergic (5-HT) nervous system has been implicated in cognitive function and feeding behavior. At present, there are a number of compounds undergoing biological testing for 5-HT6 receptor antagonism. Preclinical data have confirmed potent and selective antagonism for several compounds in vitro at the rat and human 5-HT6 receptor. Favorable cognition-enhancing effects have been demonstrated in rats, with significant improvement in memory retention, consolidation and spatial learning. Therefore, 5-HT6 antagonism has been proposed as a promising approach for treating cognitive impairment associated with neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia). Furthermore, these compounds facilitate a reduction in food intake, fat absorption and body weight in genetic and dietary models of obesity. This review summarizes the progress with 5-HT6 receptor antagonists as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease- and schizophrenia-associated cognitive dysfunction and obesity.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Purpose of review: The aim of this article is to critically review the current literature on treatment-refractory schizophrenia with an emphasis on emergent themes and key findings. Recent findings: New information continues to emerge on the impact of each second-generation antipsychotic on the treatment-refractory patient population and on the traditionally more difficult-to-treat components (e.g. cognition, suicidality, violence) of the illness. There are continued efforts with pharmacogenetics to predict response and side-effect risk with antipsychotic medications. Polypharmacy continues to be a major and poorly understood treatment practice. Summary: Our field is advancing the therapeutic nuances of therapy with second-generation antipsychotics in treatment-refractory schizophrenia. Additionally, there is a growing appreciation of the emergent adverse-effect profile of antipsychotic medications and these risk-benefit considerations are more pronounced in severely ill patients.  2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

T1  - Treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes in multiple sclerosis
A1  - Patten S.B.
Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The treatment of multiple sclerosis has been revolutionized during the past 10 years by the introduction of disease-modifying therapies. However, day-to-day management of the symptoms and complications of this condition will, for the foreseeable future, continue to be important management concerns. Among the most problematic and troublesome manifestations of multiple sclerosis are its neuropsychiatric manifestations. Most prominent among these are depression, pathologic laughing and crying, fatigue, cognitive problems, sleep disorders and disorders of sexual function. There have been relatively few randomized controlled trials of pharmacologic treatments for these conditions. Available treatments for the management of fatigue and cognitive deficits remain inadequate and patients must often accommodate these symptoms in their lifestyle.  2005 Future Drugs Ltd.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - Objective: Clinical trials are indispensable to drug approval process. This research examined the effect of a specific study criteria on recruitment and generalizability of the results. Methods: The following were reviewed: (a) the usual inclusion and exclusion criteria for the antipsychotic trials performed at the Institute; (b) epidemiologic data, to determine the effect of study criteria on the target population; and (c) the recruitment procedures/ strategies used to identify potential candidates. A survey was conducted to determine the percentage of schizophrenic patients in a conventional outpatient psychiatric clinic conforming to the usual enrollment criteria for antipsychotic trials. Results: Intensive recruitment efforts in a general population of 3.6 million would have been expected to yield only 632 eligible subjects out of 36,000 suffering from schizophrenia. Out of 632, only 50 contacted the research site after an intensive recruitment effort. From those 50, 30 were excluded during a telephone interview. Of the 20 remaining, 6 were excluded for a variety of reasons during a face-to-face interview. Thus, only 14 subjects out of a population of 3.6 million met the study criteria. Conclusions: These results emphasize the rarified nature of patients-volunteers who enter a clinical trial. Inclusion and exclusion study criteria can severely restrict the number of eligible subjects, dictate recruitment strategies, and in turn affect generalizability of the results.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - This review presents data showing that apathy is common across a number of disorders. Apathy is not only common, but is also associated with significant problems: reduced functional level, decreased response to treatment, poor illness outcome, caregiver distress, and chronicity. Preliminary evidence of treatment efficacy exists for dopaminergic drugs and for amphetamines. Strong evidence of efficacy exists for acetylcholin-esterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease, and for atypical antipsychotics in schizophrenia. Frontal-subcortical system(s) dysfunction is implicated in the causation of apathy; apathy subtypes based on the various frontal-subcortical loops may thus exist. Further research involving diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment is suggested.

T1  - On the trail of a cognitive enhancer for the treatment of schizophrenia
A1  - Stip E.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - The aim of this critical review is to address that the study of cognition and antipsychotics is not always driven by logic and that research into real pro-cognitive drug treatments must be guided by a better understanding of the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive processes and deficits. Many studies have established that typical neuroleptic drugs do not improve cognitive impairment. Atypical antipsychotics improve cognition, but the pattern of improvement differs from drug to drug. Diminished cholinergic activity has been associated with memory impairments. Why atypical drugs improve aspects of cognition might lie in their ability to increase dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex. An optimum amount of dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is critical for cognitive functioning. Another mechanism is related to procedural learning, and would explain the quality of the practice during repeated evaluations with atypical antipsychotics due to a more balanced blockage of D2 receptors. Laboratory studies have shown that clozapine, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and risperidone all selectively increase acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex, whereas this is not true for haloperidol and thioridazine. A few studies have suggested that cholinomimetics or AChE inhibitors can improve memory functions not only in Alzheimer's disease but also in other pathologies. Some studies support the role of decreased cholinergic activity in the cognitive deficits while others demonstrate that decreased choline acetyltransferase activity is related to deterioration in cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Overall, results suggest the hypothesis that the cholinergic system is involved in the cognitive dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia and that increased cholinergic activity may improve these impairments. Furthermore, a dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission could play a key role in cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Further meta-analysis of various clinical trials in this field is required to account for matters on the grounds of evidence-based medicine.  2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the representation of frail older adults in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and to assess consequences of under representation by analyzing drug discontinuation rates. Methods: A cohort of older adults newly dispensed donepezil in Ontario between September 2001 and March 2002 was constructed using administrative data. A systematic review of the literature identified RCTs of donepezil. Patients dispensed donepezil were then compared to clinical trial subjects. Discontinuation rates were examined for patients with and without potential contraindications to this drug. Results: There were 6,424 older adults in the Ontario cohort with new claims for donepezil. Ten RCTs evaluating the use of donepezil were identified (n = 3,423). Between 51% and 78% of the Ontario cohort would have been ineligible for RCT enrolment. Patient's dispensed donepezil were older (80.3 vs. 73.7 years, p<0.001) and more likely to be in long-term care (14.1 vs. 7.1%, p < 0.001) than RCT subjects. Overall, 27.8% of the Ontario cohort discontinued donepezil within seven months of initial prescription. Discontinuation rates were significantly higher for patients with a history of obstructive lung disease, active cardiovascular disease, or Parkinsonism. Conclusions: Fewer than half of the older adults dispensed donepezil in Ontario would have been eligible to participate in the RCTs that established this drug's efficacy. Discontinuation rates were higher among patient groups not represented in the trials. Clinicians should carefully assess the potential risks and benefits of such drug therapies for older patients with dementia. 2004 Canadian Society for Clinical Pharmacology. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aim: This open-label, multiple-dose trial investigated the effect of concurrent administration of donepezil HCl with risperidone on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profiles of both drugs. Methods: Sixteen male patients with schizophrenia, who were receiving stable, physician-optimized risperidone (1-4 mg twice daily), and 15 healthy age- and weight-matched male controls, received donepezil HCl 5 mg daily for 7 days. Patients with schizophrenia remained on their physician-optimized dose of risperidone throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, t max and AUC) were assessed from plasma drug concentrations measured in blood collected before, during and after administration (for 12 h after risperidone on days 0 and 7, and for 24 h after donepezil HCl on day 7). Results: The mean age of all the subjects was 38.5 years. Donepezil PK parameters were similar between patients taking donepezil HCl + risperidone (AUC0-24 h = 329.0 + 17.2 ngh ml-1) and controls taking donepezil HCl alone (AUC0-24 h = 354.7 + 28.2 ngh ml-1). Pharmacokinetic parameters for risperidone and 9-OH risperidone were not altered in patients with schizophrenia after 7 days of donepezil HCl administration (AUC0-12 h standardized by dose: risperidone = 59.6 + 16.3 ngh ml-1 at day 0, 56.0 + 15.8 ngh ml-1 at day 7; 9-OH risperidone = 162.1 + 19.2 ngh ml-1 at day 0, 163.3 + 15.0 ngh ml-1 at day 7). The most common adverse event in both treatment groups was diarrhoea (6/16 risperidone + donepezil HCl patients and 9/16 donepezil HCl only subjects). There were no significant changes in physical examination, ECG, vital signs or treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory values associated with either of the treatment regimens. No subject developed extrapyramidal side-effects following donepezil administration. Conclusions: These results suggest that once-daily dosing of 5 mg donepezil HCl does not alter the PK of risperidone in patients with schizophrenia. The combination of risperidone and donepezil HCl was well tolerated.  2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Investigations into the neurobiology, and biophysical and pharmacological properties of nicotinic receptors, also known as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), have led to an improved understanding of their role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. There is a growing body of evidence linking alterations in nicotinic receptor number and/or function to conditions such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. The implications of nicotine receptor modulation upon the clinical expression and progression of these disorders is currently under investigation, utilizing techniques that include psychopharmacological, cognitive, electrophysiological and neuroimaging analysis. This review attempts to outline evidence pertaining to the role of the nicotinic receptor system in various neuropsychiatric disorders in the context of understanding appropriate targets for therapeutic drug development.

N2  - The authors evaluated the efficacy of cholinergic drugs in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia (TD) by a systematic review of the literature on the following agents: choline, lecithin, physostigmine, tacrine, 7-methoxyacridine, ipidacrine, galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, arecoline, RS 86, xanomeline, cevimeline, deanol, and meclofenoxate. All relevant randomized controlled trials, without any language or year limitations, were obtained from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register of Trials. Trials were classified according to their methodological quality. For binary and continuous data, relative risks (RR) and weighted or standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated, respectively. Eleven trials with a total of 261 randomized patients were included in the meta-analysis. Cholinergic drugs showed a minor trend for improvement of tardive dyskinesia symptoms, but results were not statistically significant (RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.04, p=0.11). Despite an extensive search of the literature, eligible data for the meta-analysis were few and no results reached statistical significance. In conclusion, we found no evidence to support administration of the old cholinergic agents lecithin, deanol, and meclofenoxate to patients with tardive dyskinesia. In addition, two trials were found on novel cholinergic Alzheimer drugs in tardive dyskinesia, one of which was ongoing. Further investigation of the clinical effects of novel cholinergic agents in tardive dyskinesia is warranted.  2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Cigarette smoking rates in the American population are approximately 23%, whereas rates of smoking in clinical and population studies of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders are typically two- to four-fold higher. Studies conducted in a variety of neuropsychiatric populations [e.g. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia] have collectively suggested that nicotine may be efficacious in remediating selected cognitive deficits associated with these disorders, thus providing a framework for understanding the specific vulnerability of these patients to smoking initiation and maintenance. However, the specific gain in cognitive performance produced by nicotine administration in healthy subjects with normal cognitive function is less clear. This article reviews our current understanding of central nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) systems in normal and neuropsychiatric disease states and, specifically, their role with respect to cognitive dysfunction and clinical symptoms in several specific neuropsychiatric populations, including ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Tourette's Disorder, schizophrenia and affective disorders. The potential benefits of nicotinic agents for therapeutic use in neuropsychiatric disorders is discussed, as well as directions for further research in this area.

T1  - Clinical effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients with psychosis
A1  - Masand P.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The elderly represent a unique patient group in the sense that they have a high prevalence of psychotic symptoms that are a manifestation of a variety of psychiatric, neurological and organic disorders. Treatment is complicated by several factors including comorbid diagnoses (psychiatric and medical), polypharmacy, age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and high susceptibility to adverse events. Elderly patients require pharmacological interventions that are effective in reducing symptoms but also are well tolerated, improve everyday functioning, subjective well-being and treatment adherence and reduce family/carer burden. The ability of an antipsychotic to fulfil these requirements determines its clinical effectiveness. To date, few studies have investigated the clinical effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients. However, clear differences exist between the available agents, particularly with regard to tolerability profiles, which have a major impact on the clinical outcome of patients. Clinicians should select an agent that is not only effective in reducing psychotic symptoms but, more importantly, one that has a low incidence of adverse events, such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and neurocognitive problems, which are of concern in the elderly.  2004 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

T1  - Do acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have a role in improving cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia?
A1  - Lenzi A.
A1  - Tuscano D.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - At present, there are no really efficacious tools available to counteract cognitive deficits in patients with schizophrenia: even though new atypical antipsychotic drugs represent an advance compared with typical antipsychotic drugs, the results obtained with this class of drugs are actually partial. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) that have been proven to be effective on psychiatric symptoms, behavioural abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction of patients with dementia may be effective on cognitive deficit in patients with schizophrenia, and may also improve their psychopathology and behaviour. In the present paper we review the use of AChEIs in the treatment of schizophrenia. Although these AChEIs have different action mechanisms (donepezil only inhibits acetylcholinesterase; rivastigmine also inhibits butyryl-cholinesterase; galantamine also interacts with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors), they have similar clinical effects. We have observed no or mild effects on cognitive deficits and symptoms in double-blind studies, a dramatic effect on a patient's subjective well-being and ability to cope and subjective judgement of psychiatrists in the case reports and open studies. The question remains as to how we can accurately measure a patient's capacity to feel, to cope and his/her desire to live with other people - aspects very different from intelligence and cognitive function. Further double-blind placebo studies are required to determine the role of AChEIs in the improvement of quality of life for patients affected by schizophrenia.

N2  - Aim: This open-label, multiple-dose trial investigated the effect of concurrent administration of donepezil HCl with risperidone on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety profiles of both drugs. Methods: Sixteen male patients with schizophrenia, who were receiving stable, physician-optimized risperidone (1-4 mg twice daily), and 15 healthy age- and weight-matched male controls, received donepezil HCl 5 mg daily for 7 days. Patients with schizophrenia remained on their physician-optimized dose of risperidone throughout the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, t max and AUC) were assessed from plasma drug concentrations measured in blood collected before, during and after administration (for 12 h after risperidone on days 0 and 7, and for 24 h after donepezil HCl on day 7). Results: The mean age of all the subjects was 38.5 years. Donepezil PK parameters were similar between patients taking donepezil HCl + risperidone (AUC0-24 h = 329.0 + 17.2 ngh ml-1) and controls taking donepezil HCl alone (AUC0-24 h = 354.7 + 28.2 ngh ml-1). Pharmacokinetic parameters for risperidone and 9-OH risperidone were not altered in patients with schizophrenia after 7 days of donepezil HCl administration (AUC0-12 h standardized by dose: risperidone = 59.6 + 16.3 ngh ml-1 at day 0, 56.0 + 15.8 ngh ml-1 at day 7; 9-OH risperidone = 162.1 + 19.2 ngh ml-1 at day 0, 163.3 + 15.0 ngh ml-1 at day 7). The most common adverse event in both treatment groups was diarrhoea (6/16 risperidone + donepezil HCl patients and 9/16 donepezil HCl only subjects). There were no significant changes in physical examination, ECG, vital signs or treatment-emergent abnormal laboratory values associated with either of the treatment regimens. No subject developed extrapyramidal side-effects following donepezil administration. Conclusions: These results suggest that once-daily dosing of 5 mg donepezil HCl does not alter the PK of risperidone in patients with schizophrenia. The combination of risperidone and donepezil HCl was well tolerated.

T1  - Potential uses of modafinil in psychiatric disorders
A1  - Bransfield R.C.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Modafinil was administered as part of a treatment regimen in patients (N = 237) with a broad spectrum of treatment-resistant psychiatric, neurological and general medical disorders accompanied by some combination of excessive sleepiness, fatigue, executive dysfunction, and apathy. In a retrospective chart review of these patients, Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) scores were evaluated. Most patients (84.4%) showed improvement in overall clinical condition with modafinil. Most patients tolerated this agent well; the most frequently reported adverse events were overstimulation, insomnia, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress. Modafinil may offer clinical benefit for treatment-resistant hypoarousal symptoms in a number of psychiatric, neurological and general medical conditions.

T1  - Perspectives on cognitive domains, H3 receptor ligands and neurological disease
A1  - Hancock A.A.
A1  - Fox G.B.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Histamine H3 receptor agonists and antagonists have been evaluated in numerous in vitro and in vivo animal models to better understand how H3 receptors modulate neurotransmitter function in the central nervous system. Likewise, behavioural models have explored the hypothesis that changes in neurotransmitter release could enhance cognitive function in human diseases. This review examines the reported effects of H3 receptor ligands and how they influence cognitive behaviour. These data are interpreted on the basis of different cognitive domains that are relevant to neuropsychiatric diseases. Because of the diversity of H3 receptors, their function and their influence on neurotransmitter systems, considerable promise exists for H3 ligands to treat diseases in which aspects of learning and memory are impaired. However, because of the complexities of the histaminergic system and H3 receptors and the lack of clinical data so far, proof of principle for use in human disease remains to be established. 2004  Ashley Publications Ltd.

T1  - Can St. John's wort trigger psychoses?
A1  - Stevinson C.
A1  - Ernst E.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Background: St. John's wort (SJW) is a popular herbal remedy often self-prescribed for depressed mood. It has recently been associated with psychotic events. Aim: To systematically review the clinical evidence associating SJW with psychotic events. Methods: Five electronic databases were searched for all relevant reports. Data were extracted according to predefined criteria. Results: Seventeen case reports associated the use of SJW with psychotic events. In 12 instances, the diagnosis was mania or hypomania. Causality is in most cases possible. In no case was a positive rechallenge reported. Conclusion: These case reports raise the possibility that SJW may trigger episodes of mania in vulnerable patients. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility and researchers should attempt to ascertain whether the association is causal. 2004 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

N2  - Increasing evidence suggests that the cholinergic system is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Donepezil, a central cholinesterase inhibitor, improves psychotic symptomatology in demented patients, however, evidence for its role in the management of active psychosis in schizophrenia remains limited. An 18-week double blind cross-over study was conducted in which eight patients were randomly assigned to either donepezil (5 mg/day for the first 4 weeks and 10 mg/day for the following 4 weeks) or placebo as augmentation treatment to clozapine. After this initial phase, there was a 2-week washout period of the study medication after which the same regimen was crossed over at the same dose and for the same period (8 weeks). No significant difference was noted in the total positive and negative symptom scale scores when donepezil was compared with placebo (16.7% + 12.97% vs 3.20% + 13.94% respectively, p=0.18). However, three patients improved (>15%) in the total PANSS scores (37.03%, 16.6% and 25.33%) during the donepezil treatment phase, while only one patient improved (20.87%) during the placebo phase. No differences were noted in the Calgary depression scale (p=0.305), Simpson Angus scale (p=0.374), clinical global impression-improvement scale (p=0.23) and clinical global impression-severity of illness scores (p=0.116). Although this preliminary study failed to demonstrate a clear effect of donepezil augmentation in clozapine treated chronic schizophrenia patients, it seems that the subtle positive effect of donepezil observed in some of our patients should encourage further investigation in a larger sample of this patient subpopulation.

T1  - Neuropsychiatric pharmacogenetics: Moving toward a comprehensive understanding of predicting risks and response
A1  - Bishop J.R.
A1  - Ellingrod V.L.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Pharmacogenetic research in the area of neuropsychiatric illnesses is rapidly evolving. Due to the complexity of the human brain, it is not surprising that our knowledge about the interaction between genetics and the treatment of these illnesses is very small. The Human Genome Project (HGP) has identified > 30,000 genes; several thousand of which have been found to occur in the brain or serve a role that enhances the brain's function. Much of the research in the post-HGP era is being driven by a desire to use genetics to predict which patients deviate from the norm in terms of drug response or side effects. By identifying these people, we will be able to direct clinical practice such that therapies for these disorders can be individualized. With this in mind, the following review is intended to cover a broad understanding of CNS pharmacogenetics with the goal of summarizing available literature on promising candidate gene targets, which may eventually help us predict clinical outcomes in patients taking medications commonly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. 2004  Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Cognitive deficit is common and related to functional outcome in patients with schizophrenia. The possible role of adjunctive pharmacology for cognitive deficit is receiving consideration. There is a bulk of evidence suggesting an important role of cholinergic system in schizophrenia. The aim of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of augmentation of risperidone by inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase donepezil in the treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Thirty patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder on individual stable dose of risperidone were randomly assigned to double blind treatment with donepezil or placebo. They were administered the neuropsychological battery at baseline and again following 12 weeks and 16 weeks of experimental treatment. Donepezil did not produce significant improvements in any cognitive parameter compared with placebo. Our results are consistent with the other placebo controlled studies of Friedman et al. 2002 and Tugul and Yazici 2003.

T1  - Cholinergic targets for cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia: Focus on cholinesterase inhibitors and muscarinic agonists
A1  - Friedman J.I.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Rationale: Alterations in the central cholinergic system of patients with schizophrenia such as reduced numbers of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors in the cortex and hippocampus may contribute to the cognitive impairment of schizophrenia. Therefore, pharmacological treatments that enhance central cholinergic function may be useful as cognitive enhancers in schizophrenia. Methods: Searches were conducted for articles which investigated alterations of central cholinergic systems in patients with schizophrenia. Additional searches were conducted for animal and human trials of potential cognitive enhancing compounds that target the cholinergic system and any preliminary trials conducted with schizophrenic patients. Results: Currently available treatments which are potentially suitable for this purpose include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, muscarinic agonists, nicotinic agonists, and allosteric potentiators of nicotinic receptor function. Although some open label studies demonstrate modest cognitive improvements of schizophrenic patients treated with donepezil, data from a blinded, placebo controlled study demonstrate no effect. Data from a controlled trial of galantamine, a combined acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric potentiator of the nicotinic receptor, indicates that this may be an effective alternative. In addition, some preclinical data indicates that selective M1 muscarinic agonists under development may have potential as cognitive enhancers and antipsychotic treatments for schizophrenic patients. Conclusions: A cholinergic approach to ameliorating the cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia appears viable. There is some preliminary data to support the efficacy of combined acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and allosteric potentiators of the nicotinic receptor, whereas future trials are awaited for more specific muscarinic agonists currently under development.

T1  - Selective histamine H3 receptor antagonists for treatment of cognitive deficiencies and other disorders of the central nervous system
A1  - Witkin J.M.
A1  - Nelson D.L.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Evidence exists to implicate the monoamine histamine in the control of arousal and cognitive functions. Antagonists of H3 receptors are postsynaptic and presynaptic modulators of neural transmission in a variety of neuronal circuits relevant to cognition. Accumulating neuroanatomical, neurochemical, pharmacological, and behavioral data support the idea that H 3 receptor antagonists may function to improve cognitive performances in disease states (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment states). Thus, H3 receptor antagonists have been shown to increase performance in attention and memory tests in nonhuman experiments and prevent the degradation in performances produced by scopolamine, MK-801, or age. In contrast, agonists of the H3 receptor generally produce cognitive impairing effects in animal models. The role of H3 receptors in these behavioral effects is substantiated by data indicating a central origin for their effects, the selectivity of some of the H3 receptor antagonists studied, and the pharmacological modification of effects of H3 receptor antagonists by selective H3 receptor agonists. Data and issues that challenge the potential role for H3 receptor antagonists in cognitive processes are also critically reviewed. H3 receptor antagonists may also have therapeutic value in the management of obesity, pain, sleep disorders, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  2004 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Pharmacological treatment strategies for schizophrenia
A1  - Lindenmayer J.P.
A1  - Khan A.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The pharmacological choices for the treatment of schizophrenia have been greatly expanded with the availability of the atypical compounds clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen-Cilag), olanzapine, (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly & Co.), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer Inc.) and aripiprazole (Ability, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd). In this article, the effects of the newer antipsychotics and their side effects are reviewed. Key issues in acute and maintenance treatment, often lifelong, will be reviewed. Side-effect management to ensure adherence to an optimal treatment regimen will be discussed. Coexisting syndromes must be treated in concordance with the patient's clinical presentation. For treatment-resistant patients, atypical compounds are generally more effective than their typical counterparts but medication augmentation strategies are frequently recommended. Finally, the results of recent meta-analyses comparing the effects of atypical versus typical compounds will be critically reviewed and remaining gaps in the current pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia will be explored.

T1  - A double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over trial of adjunctive donepezil for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia

Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Although there have been several case reports suggesting the beneficial effect of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia, controlled studies have revealed contradictory results. The aim of this study was to investigate if donepezil could improve cognitive functions in schizophrenia. Twelve schizophrenic patients, who were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria and who had been on a stable dose of a high-potency typical antipsychotic for a minimum period of 3 months, participated in this 12-wk double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study of donepezil adjunctive treatment. Patients were randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to receive 5 mg/d donepezil or placebo for 6 wk, and then were crossed over to the alternate condition for 6 additional weeks. At baseline, 6 and 12 wk, patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Calgary Depression Scale, the Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised (WMS-R), a test for Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test, Parts A and B, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Treatment effect was not significant in any of the cognitive measures. There were also no significant changes in the PANSS and depression scores. Nicotinic receptor desensitization may cause non-responsiveness to acetylcholine as previously suggested, but the most likely explanation appears to be that defects in other neurotransmitter systems account for the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenic patients.

T1  - Review of cognition and brain structure in schizophrenia: Profiles, longitudinal course, and effects of treatment
A1  - Flashman L.A.
A1  - Green M.F.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Research on the cognitive and brain structural correlates of schizophrenia has seen tremendous progress over the past decade. It has become increasingly clear that there is no pathognomic neuropsychological or structural neuroanatomic profile in schizophrenia, likely due in part to etiological heterogeneity within the disorder. Nonetheless, several studies have indicated that verbal episodic memory and vigilance deficits are particularly prominent, and are observed even in untreated patients in their first episode of the disorder. The course of schizophrenia appears to be somewhat variable, and factors that contribute to the development of the illness, and in some patients, deterioration of cognitive functioning, have not been elucidated clearly. Neurodevelopmental factors, however, likely play an important role in the diathesis of the disorder, while neuropathological processes contribute to deterioration and progression. At this time, there are relatively few controlled comparisons of the cognitive effects of atypical and conventional antipsychotic medications. Additional studies of the potential effects of antipsychotic medications on structural brain abnormalities are warranted. It is hoped that newer innovative psychopharmacological approaches and neuropsychological remediation programs will, in the not-too-distant future, provide clinicians with a variety of means to improve the cognitive and social functioning of their patients.

T1  - Neuropsychotherapeutics in the UK: What Has Been the Impact of NICE on Prescribing?
A1  - Walley T.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) was set up in 1999 to advise the National Health Service (NHS) on the use of new technologies largely, but not exclusively, on the basis of their clinical and cost effectiveness. There have been problems with this, as with any developing system, most of which have arisen from issues not directly under the control of NICE. Despite this, NICE has already achieved a pivotal role in determining the uptake of new therapies into the NHS. In the area of neuropsychiatric therapies, NICE has examined a number of topics and has generally facilitated the increased use of the agents examined, approving the use, within limitations, of such drugs as riluzole, atypical antipsy chotics and cholinesterase inhibitors. Although the use of some of these therapies had been growing, it had previously been restricted by funding in the NHS. As a result of NICE guidance, these funding restrictions have generally been lifted. NICE has rejected one area of neurological therapy so far - that of interferon-beta products and glatiramer acetate for multiple sclerosis - on the grounds of clinical uncertainty about long-term benefits and poor cost effectiveness. However, the UK Government has created a novel risk-sharing scheme in collaboration with the sponsoring companies to make these drugs available at a level of cost effectiveness acceptable to the NHS. The feasibility of this scheme is as yet unclear. This might be seen as either a triumph for NICE or as an undermining of it for political ends. One interesting aspect that is more prominent in neuropsychiatric disorders than in other areas of NICE activity has been the power of patient advocacy in encouraging acceptance of therapies where the evidence base was weak or the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was unfavourable. The principles behind the activities of NICE attract wide support within the -NHS, but the details of its decisions have often not been popular within NHS management who have to deliver them. Some of this relates more to the context and political environment within which NICE operates than to a failing within NICE itself. NICE will continue to become increasingly important in determining the use of new drugs within the UK NHS.

T1  - Verbal memory deficit in patients with schizophrenia: An important future target for treatment
A1  - Toulopoulou T.
A1  - Murray R.M.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - Despite more than two-thirds of patients with schizophrenia showing reductions in delusions and hallucinations following optimum available treatment, many are left with crippling cognitive impairments. Neurocognitive deficit is a core feature of schizophrenia, but the question arises as to whether efforts should be geared towards ameliorating and normalizing these deficits. Verbal memory dysfunction is one of the most consistently reported cognitive deficits and among the best predictors of functional outcome in schizophrenia. Therefore, a better understanding of the nature of this deficit could lead to treatments that not only improve the specific systems mediating the impairment; but could also have wider implications for clinical and social outcome.

T1  - Donepezil: A clinical review of current and emerging indications
A1  - Roman G.
A1  - Rogers S.J.
Y1  - 2004//
N2  - This article reviews the piperidine derivative, donepezil hydrochloride (E2020, Aricept), a reversible central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor currently approved for treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil is well absorbed orally, unaffected by food or by time of administration; it reaches therapeutic levels in doses of 5 - 10 mg/day and peak plasma concentrations are obtained 3 - 4 h after oral administration. A single bedtime dose is recommended due to the long elimination half-life of the drug (70 h). Donepezil does not cause liver toxicity or significant drug interactions and is relatively well-tolerated. Initial side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, insomnia, muscle cramps, fatigue, anorexia and syncope. Caution is advised in patients with bradycardia. Long-term use of donepezil in AD has been found to delay nursing-home placement and to result in caregiver respite. Donepezil also slows deterioration of cognition and global function in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, with improvement of abnormal behaviours. In addition to AD, donepezil demonstrates significant improvement in cognition, global function and activities of daily living in comparison with placebo-treated patients with vascular dementia and has potential therapeutic benefit for other neurological conditions.

T1  - Treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease: Safety considerations
A1  - Fernandez H.H.
A1  - Trieschmann M.E.
A1  - Friedman J.H.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Psychosis only rarely occurs in patients with untreated Parkinson's disease. Much more commonly, psychosis is induced by drug therapy for Parkinson's disease and is the strongest known risk factor for nursing home placement. Delusions are less frequent than hallucinations, but are more concerning as they are often paranoid in nature. Treatment begins with a search for correctable infectious, toxic, and metabolic aetiologies. If symptoms persist, anti-Parkinson's disease medications are slowly reduced. However, withdrawal of these drugs usually worsens parkinsonism and is often not tolerated. Certain atypical antipsychotics can be used to treat psychosis without compromising motor function. The choice of atypical antipsychotic is largely based on ease of use and adverse effect profile as most have comparable efficacy in improving psychosis. Currently, there are five marketed atypical drugs - clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone. Ziprasidone is the only agent whose adverse effect profile has not been reported in Parkinson's disease. The most common adverse effects of clozapine in Parkinson's disease are sedation, orthostatic hypotension and sialorrhoea. Sedation is generally helpful since these patients are frequently awake at night and tend to have worse behavioural problems then. Clozapine does not induce deterioration of motor function, but it has the potential to cause agranulocytosis, which is idiosyncratic and not dose-related. In risperidone-treated Parkinson's disease patients, reported adverse effects include somnolence, sialorrhoea, dizziness, palpitations, constipation, delirium, fatigue, leg cramps, depression, urinary incontinence and hypotension. Although in some Parkinson's disease studies, risperidone has been well tolerated, others have shown that many patients are unable to tolerate the drug due to deterioration of motor function. While an initial study of olanzapine in Parkinson's disease psychosis showed the drug to be effective without deterioration of motor function, succeeding reports demonstrated a deleterious effect of the drug on motor functioning. The most common adverse effects of quetiapine in Parkinson' s disease patients are sedation and orthostatic hypotension. There is a lack of double-blind trials; however, cumulative reports involving >200 Parkinson's disease patients strongly suggest that quetiapine is well tolerated and effective. Unlike clozapine, it does not improve tremor and may induce mild deterioration of motor function. Recently, cholinesterase inhibitors have been reported to alleviate psychosis in Parkinson's disease. Although ondansetron, an antiemetic with antiserotonergic properties, has been reported to relieve psychosis in Parkinson's disease, its prohibitive cost has prevented further study in this population. Electroconvulsive treatment is generally reserved for the patient with psychotic depression who is unable to tolerate any pharmacological therapy.

T1  - Treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease
A1  - Burns A.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - In Alzheimer's disease, cognition now responds to several drugs. Anticholinesterases target the acetylcholine deficit. In mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, they all provide significant benefit versus placebo on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Schedule-Cognitive Section (ADAS-Cog). Side effects, in 5% to 15% of cases, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and dizziness. Tacrine, the leading anticholinesterase, caused frequent hepatic enzyme elevation and was withdrawn; once-daily donepezil spares the liver and improves global measures of change in severe dementia; rivastigmine is indicated in comorbid vascular disease; while galantamine modulates the cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that potentiate the response to acetylcholine. Alternative agents include the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, memantine, licensed in Europe for moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease; it acts on a different neurotransmitter system present in 70% of neurons, protecting against pathologic glutamergic activation while preserving or even restoring physiologic glutamergic activation. The clinician's armamentarium in AD has never been greater.

T1  - Safety and efficacy of switching psychiatric patients from a delayed-release to an extended-release formulation of divalproex sodium
A1  - Horne R.L.
A1  - Cunanan C.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of divalproex sodium extended-release (ER) when patients were switched from therapy with divalproex sodium delayed-release (DR) to divalproex sodium ER. This open-label, 7-day study included 55 patients with bipolar disorder, major depression, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or intermittent explosive disorder. Baseline plasma valproate concentrations were determined, and patients received their usual morning dose of divalproex sodium DR. At 9:00 p.m. the same day, they received divalproex sodium ER at a dose equal to their total daily dose of divalproex sodium DR. Valproate concentrations were monitored, and efficacy was measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Side effects were assessed using the Udvalg for Kliniske Undersogelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale. Valproate concentrations for 52 patients remained within the therapeutic range. Inpatient PANSS scores significantly improved from baseline to final evaluation on all subscales. For the combined inpatient and outpatient populations, a small but statistically significant improvement from baseline to final evaluation was seen for positive, general, and total PANSS subscale scores. At study's end, patients reported a significant decrease in the number and severity of adverse events; 54 of 55 patients elected to continue therapy with once-daily divalproex sodium ER. This study suggests that divalproex sodium ER is at least as effective as the DR formulation for treating patients with psychiatric illness and may be better tolerated. The ER formulation offers the advantage of once-daily dosing, which may help improve compliance.

T1  - Neuropsychology in schizophrenia: An update
A1  - Hoff A.L.
A1  - Kremen W.S.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Purpose of review: The treatment of schizophrenia has presented many challenges. Despite the fact that 70% of patients are partially or fully treatment responsive, i.e. positive symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are significantly reduced by antipsychotic medication, many of these responders are left with debilitating thought disorganization, motivational deficits, and disabilities in multiple cognitive domains. The latter disabilities are now thought to be strongly related to clinical outcome, perhaps more than positive and negative symptoms. This article will review recent studies addressing these deficits. Recent findings: In the past year, studies have demonstrated that cognitive disorders in schizophrenia are widespread, with particular problems noted in attention, declarative memory, and higher-order problem-solving. These deficits appear at the onset of the illness and are stable throughout, but may interact with the aging process, as there is some evidence of cognitive deterioration in older patients. Evidence is accumulating that these deficits are related to abnormalities in the frontal and limbic brain structures, genetic markers, and to social and work outcomes. Atypical antipsychotic medications, cognitive enhancers, and cognitive rehabilitation appear promising as possible treatment approaches. Summary: As a core symptom, neuropsychological dysfunction specific to the disorder must be precisely defined and targeted for remediation if these patients are to be treated effectively. Because of the heterogeneity of the disorder, different treatments may be effective in certain subgroups, and certain cognitive abilities may be more responsive to intervention and more relevant to clinical outcome than others. There is much to accomplish in the treatment of this disabling disorder.  2003 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Comorbid schizophrenia and dementia is a common clinical phenomenon; however, management of the coexisting illnesses remains incomplete. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, may be beneficial for the management of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, a disease in which cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and basal forebrain are well known to be compromised. Furthermore, impaired cognition in elderly schizophrenic patients has been observed to be more than two thirds; however, there are no published controlled studies reporting the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in the management of schizophrenia in patients with associated dementia. In this study, six patients with chronic schizophrenia and comorbid dementia were administered donepezil, 5 mg, in single-blind fashion as augmentation to their standard antipsychotic medication for a 4-week period. Patients were evaluated with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE); Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, Cognitive subscale; Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS); and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales. A significant improvement was noted in MMSE scores (p < 0.01) and for CGI scores (p < 0.01). In addition, three patients demonstrated improvement on the PANSS. Donepezil appears to be an effective treatment for the management of symptoms of dementia accompanying patients with comorbid schizophrenia and dementia. Since cholinergic dysfunction may be present in some patients with schizophrenia, the authors' findings further demonstrate the possibility that this disorder may be managed with cholinergic medications as augmenting agents, at least in this specific subpopulation of patients with comorbid dementia. To confirm the findings of this preliminary trial, further investigation is mandated with a larger sample of subjects in the context of a double-blind medication trial.

N2  - During the 16th ECNP Congress several novel and promising new drugs were presented that could potentially lead to improvements in the therapy of neuropsychiatric disorders. A number of new receptors are currently under investigation as possible targets for the treatment of psychopharmacologic disease. The alpha7, nicotinic receptor is of particular interest for the treatment of dementia, while the metabotropic glutamate receptor could be relevant in anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. The D3 receptor could also be of therapeutic significance in schizophrenia.

T1  - Psychotic disorders in the elderly
A1  - Hewitt J.
Y1  - 2003//
N2  - Psychotic symptoms, specifically delusions and hallucinations, are not uncommon amongst geriatric inpatients. These symptoms are associated with a number of serious mental disorders which may be classified into three groups; organic psychoses (dementia and delirium), functional psychoses (schizophrenia and other non affective psychoses) and affective psychoses (psychotic depression and mania). With the general physician and geriatrician in mind, this article discusses the assessment, differential diagnosis and treatment of psychosis in the elderly.

N2  - Cognitive impairments are cardinal features of schizophrenia and predictors of poor vocational and social outcome. Imaging studies with verbal fluency tasks (VFT) lead some to suggest that in schizophrenia, the combination of a failure to deactivate the left temporal lobe and a hypoactive frontal lobe reflects a functional disconnectivity between the left prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. Others have theorized that an abnormal cingulate gyrus modulates such fronto-temporal connectivity. Thus addition of a cognitive enhancing medication to current antipsychotic therapy might improve functionality of networks necessary in working memory and internal concept generation. To test this hypothesis, we serially measured brain activity in 6 subjects on stable atypical antipsychotics performing a VFT, using BOLD fMRI. Measurements were made at baseline and again after groups were randomized to receive 12 weeks of donepezil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) and placebo in a blind cross-over design. Donepezil addition provided a functional normalization with an increase in left frontal lobe and cingulate activity when compared to placebo and from baseline scans. This pilot study supports the cingulate's role in modulating cognition and neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia.

N2  - A pilot study was conducted to examine if donepezil could enhance cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia. Fifteen subjects who were on stable olanzapine treatment were entered into a 6-week open-labeled trial of donepezil. Subjects received baseline and end-of-study P50 and neuropsychological assessments. Donepezil treatment resulted in significant improvement in manual dexterity. There were moderate improvements in verbal recall memory and visual memory and processing speed, with smaller changes in P50 and verbal recognition memory. There was no effect on an attention measure. There were no changes in either positive or negative symptoms. These results suggest that cholinergic tone modulation may enhance selective behavioral functions in patients with schizophrenia, but further study is required to delineate the full extent of the potential benefit of this approach.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

T1  - Cholinergic medication for neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tardive dyskinesia remains a troublesome adverse effect of conventional antipsychotic (neuroleptic) medication. It has been proposed that tardive dyskinesia could have a component of central cholinergic deficiency. Cholinergic drugs have been used to treat tardive dyskinesia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of cholinergic drugs (arecoline, choline, deanol, lecithin, meclofenoxate, physostigmine, RS 86, tacrine, metoxytacrine, galantamine, ipidacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, eptastigmine, metrifonate, xanomeline, cevimeline) for treating neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia or other chronic mental illness. SEARCH STRATEGY: An electronic search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register (October 2001) was undertaken. This register is assembled by extensive searches for randomised controlled trials in many electronic databases, registers of conference proceedings and dissertations. References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Principal authors of trials were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Reports identified by the search were included if they were of controlled trials dealing with people with neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia and chronic mental illness, who had been randomly allocated to either a cholinergic agent or to a placebo or no intervention. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality of trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers extracted data and, where possible, estimated relative risks (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis, with the assumption that people who dropped out had no improvement. MAIN RESULTS: We included eleven studies investigating the use of older cholinergic drugs compared with placebo. Most studies involved small numbers of participants (5-20 people). We found no completed trials of the new cholinergic Alzheimer drugs for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Cholinergic drugs did not result in any substantial improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms when compared with placebo (8 RCTs, 170 people, RR no important improvement 0.84 CI 0.68 to 1.04). Neither did tardive dyskinesia symptoms increase (7 RCTs, 137 people, RR deterioration in tardive dyskinesia 1.17 CI 0.55 to 2.50). Pooled results for endpoint AIMS scores were equivocal (4 RCTs, 86 people, WMD -0.19 CI -0.53 to 0.14). Deanol may cause gastric adverse effects (5 RCTs, 61 people, RR 9.00 CI 0.55-148) and other adverse effects such as sedation and peripheral cholinergic effects (6 RCTs, 94 people, RR 6.83 CI 0.99-47). One study reported on global outcome. Meclofenoxate was neither clearly helpful nor harmful when compared with placebo (1 RCT, 60 people, RR not of global benefit 0.89 CI 0.59 to 1.32). We found no difference between people allocated cholinergics and those given placebo for the outcome of leaving the study before completion (10 RCTs, 240 people, RR 0.52 CI 0.21 to 1.33). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Tardive dyskinesia remains a major public health problem. The clinical effects of older cholinergic drugs are unclear, as too few, too small studies leave many questions unanswered. Cholinergic drugs should remain of interest to researchers and currently have little place in routine clinical work. However, with the advent of new cholinergic agents now used for treating Alzheimer's disease, scope exists for more informative trials. If these new cholinergic agents are to be investigated for treating people with tardive dyskinesia, their effects should be demonstrated in well-designed, conducted and reported randomised trials.

N2  - As response to an official technical consultation from the national Health Department, the Institute of Psychiatry of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (IPUB/UFRJ), Brazil, and its World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre in Mental Health, claims favourable to the inclusion of quetiapine fumarate in the local Exceptional Drugs List in addition to former inclusion of clozapine and two other atypical antipsychotics (risperidone and olanzapine). Suggestions for preliminary prescription guidelines at the national Health System services are made. The medical and social importance of the governmental initiative are saliented and examined under the light of WHO drugs policy statements. The scarcity of local long-term controlled comparative trials with larger samples, as well as pharmacoeconomic analysis and outcomes data on quality of life and social functioning that would authorize preference by one or some over the others of the new agents, is strengthened. On the basis of the therapeutic efficacy and security profile already demonstrated, it is suggested to hold the prerequisite of refractoriness only clozapine prescription, giving access to the new medicines for the young patients with first episodes of schizophrenia or for the older ones with a history of serious intolerance to the typical agents. The superior costs of the new medicines however, would justify if necessary, regional allotment. Additional reasons against the generalized adoption of the new drugs are: 1) the inexistence of depot preparations with the new atypical antipsychotics; 2) the need for more rational use of the cheaper traditional agents so reaching better extrapyramidal tolerability and minimal iatrogenic (negative and cognitive) symptoms, and 3) the need for continuing advances in the institutional reform process allowing the offering of more family orientation/support and psico-social rehabilitation services. In the absence of a differential therapeutic superiority clearly demonstrated already by one of the new atypical antipsychotics over the others, the choice should rely on safety profile of each drug (extrapyramidal, neuroendocrine, weight gain, metabolic, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, thyroidal) considering the patient's preexisting medical conditions or special risks. Possible quetiapine advantages by virtue of its superior extrapyramidal and neuroendocrine safety profiles as well as its virtual absence of muscarinic affinity and epileptogenic activity are considered. Disadvantages in terms of its stronger sedative and hypothensive effects and of thyroid dysfunction risk (decrease of T4 and increase of TSH levels), although usually benign and reversible along the treatment, are also stressed.

N2  - Background: Despite the beneficial effects of atypical antipsychotics on cognition, these improvements will not return most schizophrenic patients to normative standards of cognitive functioning. Therefore, other treatments need to be considered. Subtle changes in cholinergic function in schizophrenic patients provide the rationale to test the effectiveness of cholinesterase inhibitors in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Methods: Given this, a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of donepezil (5 mg and 10 mg) as adjunctive treatment to risperidone was conducted in a total of 36 schizophrenic patients. Results: Neither the 5-mg nor 10-mg dose of donepezil produced significant improvements in any cognitive measure compared with placebo. Conclusions: It is possible that nicotinic receptor desensitization produced by chronic tobacco use in these patients rendered their nicotinic receptors refractory to the effects of increased agonist activity produced by donepezil. An alternative treatment is the allosterically potentiating ligands, which enhance the activity of (sensitize) nicotinic receptors in the presence of acetylcholine.  2002 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

N2  - Objective: To assess the clinical and cognitive effects of adding donepezil, a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, to the risperidone treatment of a high functioning stable out-patient with schizophrenia. Method: Case study using an experimental ABAB design. Assessments were completed objectively by standardized neuropsychological tests and clinical rating scales and subjectively with visual analogue scales. Results: Strong improvements attributable to donepezil were found for verbal fluency and the patient's subjective response. No adverse changes were noted in psychiatric symptoms or side effects. Conclusion: Cholinergic enhancement as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia should be explored in larger controlled trials.

T1  - An evaluation of risperidone drug interactions
A1  - DeVane C.L.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is widely used in the treatment of psychoses associated with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Polypharmacology is a necessary condition for the optimal treatment of many patients with comorbid psychiatric and medical illness. One concern raised by the widespread use of multiple concurrent pharmacotherapies is the potential for drug-drug interactions to adversely affect patient outcome. Accordingly, the biomedical literature was reviewed for reports of drug interactions involving risperidone, and the clinical significance of each report was evaluated. Additionally, the potential for risperidone to participate in drug interactions was evaluated by considering the drug's pharmacokinetic properties. Controlled studies and case reports indicate that risperidone has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 or induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter risperidone plasma concentrations, but the clinical significance of such interactions seems to be minimal. Adherence to a few guidelines for the design of dosage regimens should limit the effect of drug-drug interactions on patient status and contribute to optimal pharmacotherapy with risperidone.

N2  - Cognitive impairment in multiple domains is common in patients with schizophrenia and may be a powerful determinant of poor functional ability and quality of life. We report a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of donepezil augmentation in a schizoaffective disorder patient stabilized on olanzapine pharmacotherapy. The patient showed significant improvements in several cognitive measures and increased activation of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia on functional MRI during the donepezil augmentation. In addition, the donepezil augmentation resulted in a reduction of depressive symptoms and in significant improvements in functional abilities and quality of life. Further studies of donepezil augmentation of neuroleptics in schizophrenia are warranted.

N2  - The Forensic Algorithm Project (FAP) was born of the need for a holistic approach in the treatment of the inmate with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was chosen as the first entity to be addressed by the algorithm because of its refractory nature and high rate of recidivism in the correctional setting. Schizophrenia is regarded as a spectrum disorder, with symptom clusters and behaviors ranging from positive to negative symptoms to neurocognitive dysfunction and affective instability. Furthermore, the clinical picture is clouded by Axis II symptomatology (particularly prominent in the inmate population), comorbid Axis I disorders, and organicity. Four subgroups of schizophrenia were created to coincide with common clinical presentations in the forensic inpatient facility and also to parallel 4 tracks of intervention, consisting of pharmacologic management and programming recommendations. The algorithm begins with any antipsychotic medication and proceeds to atypical neuroleptic usage, augmentation with other psychotropic agents, and, finally, the use of clozapine as the common pathway for refractory schizophrenia. Outcome measurement of pharmacologic intervention is assessed every 6 weeks through the use of a 4-item subscale, specific for each forensic subgroup. A 'floating threshold' of 40% symptom severity reduction on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale items over a 6-week period is considered an indication for neuroleptic continuation. The forensic algorithm differs from other clinical practice guidelines in that specific programming in certain prison environments is stipulated. Finally, a social commentary on the importance of state-of-the-art psychiatric treatment for all members of society is woven into the clinical tapestry of this article.

T1  - Pharmacologic strategies for augmenting cognitive performance in schizophrenia

Y1  - 1999//
N2  - There is recognition that the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia have the most substantial impact on illness outcome. Domains of cognition reported to be significantly affected include serial learning, executive function, vigilance, and distractibility, to name a few. Dopamine activity at D1 receptors mediates many cognitive processes subserved by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly working memory. The number of D1 receptors in the PFC is decreased in schizophrenics and is unaffected by chronic administration of typical neuroleptics. Therefore, medications that increase dopamine in the PFC, such as atypical neuroleptics, or that directly activate the D1 receptor may prove useful in the remediation of prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Decreased levels of cortical norepinephrine (NE) are associated with impaired learning and working memory in animal models, and can be reversed by drugs that restore NE activity. More specifically, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists have been particularly effective in improving delayed response performance in young monkeys with localized 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the PFC. Furthermore, human postmortem studies have demonstrated decreased NE in the frontal cortex of demented schizophrenic patients. Therefore, alpha-2 receptor agonists hold promise as drugs to improve cognitive performance on tasks dependent upon PFC function in schizophrenics. Finally, the finding that cortical choline acetyl transferase activity correlates with Clinical Dementia Rating scores in schizophrenic patients and that cholinomimetic drugs enhance cognition in healthy subjects suggests that cholinergic drugs may also treat cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Two potential types of cholinomimetics for use in schizophrenics are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and M1/M4 muscarinic agonists, both of which increase cortical cholinergic activity.

N2  - A rational approach to postinjury pharmacologic treatment relies on the formation of theories and models. The limitations of the knowledge base must lead to the integration of basic scientific discoveries into clinical decision making, thereby increasing understanding of normal and pathologic states. This will lead to the development of more rationally based pharmacologic approaches to modify neurotransmitters and the neuromodulatory activity of damaged neuronal systems.
